# Ensoniq ES5503 (ES5503)

a sound chip designed by Robert "Bob" Yannes (the same guy who designed the [MOS Technology SID](c64.md)). it features 32 time-multiplexed channels (oscillators) of wavetable/sample audio.

it was used in some Ensoniq synthesizers and in Apple IIGS computer.

chip has 8 audio output channels, but each oscillator can be connected to only one output. Furnace maps them left-right-left-right-... by default. there's an option to downmix chip output to mono audio (as it was on original Apple IIGS).

the chip allows limited inter-channel effects (AM and hard sync).

since chip output is time-multiplexed, disabling some channels must improve sample rate. However, last channel is used for some interrupts on Apple IIGS. furnace does not change sample rate of the chip, though.

## effects

- `11xx`: **set number of enabled oscillators.**
  - `xx` is `2` to `1F`. Currently does not affect chip's sample rate.
- `12xx`: **set oscillator output.**
  - `xx` is `0` to `7`. `0`=left, `1`=right. Other outputs can be mapped via [Patchbay](../mixer.md).
- `13xx`: **set wave/sample length.**
  - `xx` is `0` to `7`. `0`=256 bytes, `1`=512 bytes, etc. up to `32768` bytes.
- `14xx`: **set wave/sample posiiton in memory.** Memory offset is `xx * 256` bytes.
- `15xx`: **set oscillator mode.** Memory offset is `xx * 256` bytes.
  - `xx` is `0` to `3`. `0`=freerun, `3`=swap mode.
