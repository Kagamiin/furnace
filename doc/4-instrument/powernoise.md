# PowerNoise instrument editor

the PowerNoise instrument editor consists of two tabs.

## LFSR-based synthesis

this will be finished later... it's so late and I need to sleep now

## Macros

- **Volume**: volume sequence.
- **Arpeggio**: pitch sequence.
- **Duty/Noise**: duty cycle and noise mode.
  - pulse duty cycles:
    - `0`: 12.5%
    - `1`: 25%
    - `2`: 50%
    - `3`: 75%
  - noise modes:
    - `0`: long noise
    - `1`: short noise
- **Pitch**: fine pitch.
- **Phase Reset**: trigger restart of waveform.

## PowerNoise tab

this tab allows you to change the base octave - important when you have set a longer LFSR pattern.
